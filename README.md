Secure Software Requirements
============================

[![Project Status: Abandoned â€“ Initial development has started, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release; the project has been abandoned and the author(s) do not intend on continuing development.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/abandoned.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#abandoned)

Whether outsourcing software development or taking a project in-house,
well-documented, and tracked software requirements are vital for the software
to function properly. Software requirements maintain product quality, help
guage timelines, prevent scope creep, and minimize post-launch defects. In sort,
software requirements lead towards making the customer happy.

Secure software development can be characterized by its adherance to
reliability, resiliancy, and recoverability. In the same respect, requirements
must be weighed by business owners to determine acceptable risk thresholds. As
part of developing the overall scope of project requirements, generating a
software security profile can help expose trade-offs in evaluating risk.

This questionnaire contains questions to ask about a project before beginning
development of web applcations, including the CIA triad. Many of the questions
are deeply technical and may not be able to be answered by marketing or
promotions departments. Some of the questions are intended to be answered by
more technical members of the acquiring group who understand terminology like
"Man in the Middle" or Extended Validation in the context of SSL.
